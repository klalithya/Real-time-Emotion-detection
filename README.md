# Real-time-Emotion-detection
In order to examine students' facial expressions throughout class, I created a real-time emotion detecting system. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) used in this study were trained using the FER-2013 dataset.

Implementation: A webcam is used to recognize emotions in real time when the model is installed on a Jetson Nano. Anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise are the seven categories into which it divides expressions.


Obstacles Overcome: OpenCV compatibility, optimizer mistakes, and the difficulties of training on a big dataset were all successfully resolved.

Future Plans: This technology will be incorporated into a platform for classroom management that includes a web dashboard for in-the-moment emotional monitoring.
